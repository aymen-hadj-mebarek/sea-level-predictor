# Sea Level Rise Analysis

This project is part of the **Data Analysis with Python** certification program offered by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize sea level rise data from the EPA using various statistical and plotting techniques.

## Project Overview

The project involves visualizing sea level data using the following methods:

1. **Scatter Plot**: Displays the relationship between year and sea level.
2. **Line of Best Fit**: Two lines of best fit are created:
    - One for the entire dataset.
    - Another specifically for data from the year 2000 onwards.

## Objectives

- **Understand Data Trends**: Analyze sea level changes over time and identify trends.
- **Visualization Skills**: Apply statistical techniques to visualize and interpret data effectively.
- **Data Analysis**: Enhance skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and plotting.

## Files

- `epa-sea-level.csv`: The dataset containing sea level data.
- `sea_level_plot.png`: The generated plot showing the rise in sea level.

## How to Run

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
    
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    
    - Open the notebook file `sea_level_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    - Execute all cells to generate and save the plot.
3. **Check the Output**:
    
    - After running the notebook, the plot will be saved as `sea_level_plot.png` in the same directory.

## Results

The plot includes:

- A scatter plot of the sea level data.
- A red line representing the line of best fit for the entire dataset.
- A green line representing the line of best fit for data from 2000 onwards.

## Impact on Data Science Career

This project showcases skills in data analysis and visualization, which are crucial for a career in data science. By working with real-world data and applying statistical techniques, you improve your ability to interpret complex datasets and communicate insights effectively.
